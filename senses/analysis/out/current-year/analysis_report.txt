  Forearm vs Palm: p = 0.0012
  Back vs Palm: p = 0.0000

4. GENDER COMPARISONS
-------------------------
Significant gender differences (p < 0.05):
  No significant gender differences found.

5. INTERPRETATION
--------------------
Most sensitive region: Fingertip (2.10 mm)
Least sensitive region: Back (24.50 mm)

DISCUSSION:
The results show varying tactile sensitivity across different body regions.
This variation is consistent with the known distribution of mechanoreceptors:
- Fingertips typically have the highest density of receptors (smallest threshold)
- Back and forearm typically have lower receptor density (larger threshold)
- The results reflect the functional importance of different body parts
  for tactile discrimination tasks.
